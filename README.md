# tolkien-text-generator


## Goal
By fine tuning a LLM using the works of Tolkien, I hope to produce a model capable of writing original "Tolkien-esque" text. By original, I mean text that is not simply an exact copy of sentences used by Tolkien in his works.

In principal, the same exact fine tuning process can be used with a different dataset to produce a model that generates text more similar to the dataset.

## About
This project is in the introductory stages.
